# quicklex
automated german->sverige->icelandic translation with islex  

this is a flask app. it has only one route: `/`  
it provides an input field to enter german which is translated to sverige, and than loads islex.is in an iframe with the swedish translation plugged into the search. uses google translate api for the first step.
